   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

       <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
       ...
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ~/git/Indranil2020.github.io
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification"
