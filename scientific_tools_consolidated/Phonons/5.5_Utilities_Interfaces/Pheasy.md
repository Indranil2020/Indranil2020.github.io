## Overview
Pheasy is a robust and user-friendly program for first-principles phonon physics. It accurately reconstructs the potential energy surface of crystalline solids via a Taylor expansion of arbitrarily high order. Developed to enable efficient and accurate extraction of interatomic force constants (IFCs) from force-displacement datasets, it is designed to be parameter-free and high-throughput compatible.
