# DMDW

## Official Resources
- **Homepage**: UNKNOWN
- **Status**: UNCERTAIN / UNVERIFIED

## Overview
DMDW appears in the master list but no definitive software package with this name was found in the context of phonon transport codes during verification. It is possible this refers to "Diffusive Molecular Dynamics" (method) or is an internal code/typo.

**Confidence Level**: UNCERTAIN

## Note
If DMDW refers to a specific phonon or molecular dynamics code, it may be a private research code or a misspelling.

## Recommendation
For diffusive thermal transport or molecular dynamics, consider:
- **LAMMPS**: For molecular dynamics thermal transport.
- **ShengBTE/phono3py**: For BTE-based transport.

## Verification & Sources
**Status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN - Insufficient information found in public domain.
