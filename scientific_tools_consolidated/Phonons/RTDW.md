## Overview
RTDW appears in the master list with UNCERTAIN confidence. The tool name and resources are unclear, possibly representing a typo, abbreviation for an internal research code, or a tool with limited public documentation. Without verifiable resources, comprehensive documentation cannot be provided.

**Confidence Level**: UNCERTAIN

## Note
If RTDW refers to a specific phonon or thermal transport code, please provide:
- Full name or expansion of acronym
- Institution or research group
- Publications or documentation
- Repository or download location

**Possible interpretations**:
- Research code acronym (speculative)
- Internal or proprietary tool
- Typo or abbreviation error

## Recommendation
For phonon and thermal transport calculations, users should consider well-documented alternatives:
- **phonopy/phono3py**: Standard phonon calculations
- **ALAMODE**: Anharmonic lattice dynamics
- **ShengBTE**: Boltzmann transport equation solver
- **Phoebe**: GPU-accelerated thermal transport

## Verification & Sources
**Status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN - Insufficient information

**Verification status**: ❌ UNVERIFIED
- Resources: UNKNOWN
- Recommendation: Use established alternatives unless specific information available
