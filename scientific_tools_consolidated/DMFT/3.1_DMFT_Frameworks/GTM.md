## Overview
GTM (Generalized Toolkit for Many-body) is a module/component within the DMFTwDFT framework. It is not a standalone code but rather part of the DMFTwDFT infrastructure for handling many-body calculations. As a module rather than an independent software package, GTM provides specific functionality within the larger DMFTwDFT ecosystem.

**Scientific domain**: Many-body methods, component of DMFTwDFT  
**Target user community**: DMFTwDFT users (internal module)

## Theoretical Methods
- Many-body calculation utilities
- Part of DMFTwDFT workflow
- Support functions for DMFT calculations

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- **Note**: GTM is a MODULE within DMFTwDFT, not standalone software
- Provides toolkit functionality for DMFTwDFT
- Many-body calculation support
- Integration with DMFTwDFT workflows

**Sources**: Master list notes: "MODULE - Part of DMFTwDFT (Generalized Toolkit for Many-body)"

## Inputs & Outputs
**As a module**: Used internally by DMFTwDFT

**Input/Output**: Handled through DMFTwDFT framework

## Interfaces & Ecosystem
- **DMFTwDFT**: Internal module/component
- **Not standalone**: Functions as part of larger package
- **Usage**: Through DMFTwDFT workflows

## Limitations & Known Constraints
- **MODULE STATUS**: Not a standalone code
- Cannot be used independently of DMFTwDFT
- Documentation within DMFTwDFT package
- No separate installation or repository
- Functionality accessed via DMFTwDFT

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**:
