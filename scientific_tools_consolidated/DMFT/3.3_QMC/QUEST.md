# QUEST (QUantum Electron Simulation Toolbox)

## Official Resources

## Overview
The entry "QUEST" in the context of QMC likely refers to a quantum Monte Carlo or quantum simulation tool, though multiple codes share this name. The most relevant appears to be implementations related to quantum many-body simulations or lattice QMC methods. Due to name ambiguity, this entry should be verified for the specific QUEST code intended in the master list context.

**Scientific domain**: Quantum simulation/QMC (name ambiguous)  
**Target user community**: Context-dependent

## Possible Interpretations

### QUEST (Lattice QMC):
- Quantum lattice simulations
- Many-body methods
- Research implementation
- Specific group development

### QuEST (Quantum Simulator):
- Quantum circuit simulation
- Different focus (quantum computing)
- Not QMC for electronic structure
- Modern quantum simulation toolkit

## Status
**Note**: Name ambiguity requires clarification
- Multiple codes named QUEST
- Context suggests QMC/many-body tool
- Verification needed for specific implementation

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**:
1. GitHub search: Multiple QUEST projects

**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - Name ambiguity

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (NAME AMBIGUITY)
- **Category**: Uncertain - multiple codes
- **Note**: "QUEST" appears in master list under QMC category. Multiple quantum simulation codes use this name. Specific implementation unclear. May refer to:
  1. Lattice QMC tool (research group)
  2. Quantum many-body simulator
  3. Other quantum simulation code
- **Recommendation**: Clarify which specific QUEST implementation is intended. For production QMC, use well-established codes (QMCPACK, CASINO, ALPS, etc.)
