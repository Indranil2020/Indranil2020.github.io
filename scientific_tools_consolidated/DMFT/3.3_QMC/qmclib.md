# qmclib (Quantum Monte Carlo Library)

## Official Resources
- Homepage: Various GitHub repositories with this name
- Documentation: Repository-dependent
- Source Repository: Multiple implementations exist
- License: Repository-specific

## Overview
"qmclib" appears as a generic name for quantum Monte Carlo library implementations, with multiple repositories and projects using this designation. Rather than a single unified code, qmclib likely refers to various QMC library implementations developed by different research groups. These typically provide building blocks, utilities, or educational implementations of QMC algorithms.

**Scientific domain**: QMC libraries, utilities, educational implementations  
**Target user community**: Context-dependent, educational or research-specific

## Possible Interpretations

### QMC Library Collections:
- Utility libraries
- Algorithm implementations
- Educational codes
- Research tools
- Building blocks

### Educational Resources:
- Learning QMC
- Algorithm demonstrations
- Code examples
- Teaching tools

## Status
**Note**: Generic name, multiple implementations
- Various repositories named "qmclib"
- Educational or utility focus likely
- Not single production code
- Repository-specific details

## Related Production Codes
For production QMC calculations:
- **QMCPACK**: Continuum QMC
- **CASINO**: Feature-rich QMC
- **PyQMC**: Python QMC
- **ALPS/ALF**: Lattice QMC
- **HANDE/NECI**: FCIQMC

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - Generic name

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (GENERIC NAME)
- **Category**: Generic library name
- **Note**: "qmclib" is a generic name used by multiple QMC library/utility implementations. Not a specific unified production code. May refer to:
  1. Educational QMC implementations
  2. Utility libraries for QMC
  3. Research group-specific tools
  4. Algorithm demonstration codes
- **Recommendation**: For production work, use established codes (QMCPACK, CASINO, PyQMC, ALPS, HANDE, etc.). If specific qmclib implementation is intended, requires clarification of which repository/project.
