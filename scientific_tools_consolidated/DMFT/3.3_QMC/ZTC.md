## Recommendation
For zero-temperature QMC or related methods, consider:
- **NRG**: Zero-temperature impurity (NRGLjubljana)
- **ED**: Exact ground states (EDIpack, HΦ, Pomerol)
- **DMC**: Ground state projections (QMCPACK, CASINO)
- **FCIQMC**: Ground states (NECI, HANDE)

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - No source found

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (NO SOURCE FOUND)
- **Category**: UNKNOWN
- **Note**: "ZTC" listed in master list under QMC category but no reliable source, code repository, or documentation identified. May be:
  - Internal/unpublished research code
  - Acronym for group-specific tool
  - Historical or deprecated code
  - Misidentification or variant name
  - Zero-temperature calculation method (unverified)
- **Status**: Cannot verify without additional information
- **Recommendation**: Seek clarification on specific code/method intended, or use established alternatives for zero-temperature/ground-state calculations
