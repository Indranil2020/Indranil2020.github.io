## Overview
KKRnano is a massively parallel implementation of the KKR (Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker) method developed at Forschungszentrum Jülich for extreme-scale computing. Designed to scale to hundreds of thousands of cores on leadership supercomputers, KKRnano enables KKR calculations for very large systems and complex materials. It represents the HPC-optimized variant of KKR methods from the Jülich group.
