# DP-Code (Density Perturbation Code)

## Official Resources

## Overview
DP (Density Perturbation) codes are research implementations related to density perturbation theory and excited-state calculations, often in the context of GW/BSE methods. These are typically internal research tools within specific groups (e.g., related to Yambo or BerkeleyGW development) rather than standalone public software. The "DP" designation may refer to specific algorithms or modules within larger codes rather than a distinct software package.

**Status**: Research tool/module, not standalone public software

## Context

### Density Perturbation:
- Related to GW/BSE calculations
- Perturbation theory approaches
- Research methodologies
- Internal computational tools
- Not standalone software

### Relation to Established Codes:
- May be modules in Yambo
- Related to BerkeleyGW workflows
- Research group specific
- Development tools
- Not publicly distributed as DP-Code

## Information Gap
- No standalone public repository
- No official DP-Code documentation
- Likely internal research designation
- Not a distinct software package
- Research group terminology

## Recommendation
For density perturbation and excited-state calculations, use established codes:
- **Yambo**: Comprehensive GW/BSE with density response
- **BerkeleyGW**: Many-body perturbation theory
- **WEST**: Large-scale GW
- **Quantum ESPRESSO**: turbo modules for perturbations

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: None for standalone "DP-Code"
**Secondary sources**: Research literature on density perturbation
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - Research designation, not standalone software

**Verification status**: ⚠️ NOT STANDALONE SOFTWARE
- Status: **RESEARCH TOOL/MODULE** - Not distinct public software
- Likely internal designation or module name
- **Recommendation**: Use established codes (Yambo, BerkeleyGW, WEST) for production perturbation theory calculations
