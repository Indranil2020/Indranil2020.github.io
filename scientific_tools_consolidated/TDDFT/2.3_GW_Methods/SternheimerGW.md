## Overview
SternheimerGW is a research implementation of the GW approximation using Sternheimer linear-response approach, developed primarily at Oxford/Imperial College and related research groups. Unlike standard GW implementations that require explicit summation over empty states, SternheimerGW uses linear-response techniques to avoid this summation, potentially offering computational advantages. The code has limited public distribution and is primarily used within specific research collaborations.
