## Overview
SternheimerGW is a specialized GW code utilizing the Sternheimer linear-response approach to avoid explicit summation over empty states. Developed and maintained by Feliciano Giustino’s group (CQME at UT Austin), it offers an efficient alternative to standard sum-over-states implementations, integral to the EPW and Quantum ESPRESSO ecosystems.
