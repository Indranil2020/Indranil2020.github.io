## Overview
TDAP appears to be a research code or method abbreviation, possibly standing for "Time-Dependent Auxiliary-field" or similar, but no concrete public information, documentation, or active repository has been identified. It may be an internal research tool, a discontinued project, or a specialized method within a specific research group. Without verifiable sources, its exact nature and capabilities cannot be confirmed.

**Status**: Unverified research code or method

## Information Gap
- No accessible public repository
- No official documentation found
- No active community identified
- Minimal references in literature
- Status unclear (internal tool, discontinued, or highly specialized)

## Recommendation
For time-dependent calculations and excited-state methods, use well-established codes:
- **Octopus**: Real-space TDDFT
- **Quantum ESPRESSO**: turbo modules for TDDFT
- **Yambo**: GW/BSE
- **BerkeleyGW**: Many-body perturbation theory
- **WEST**: Large-scale GW

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: None accessible
**Secondary sources**: Minimal information
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - No verifiable information

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Status: **UNKNOWN** - Insufficient information for verification
- **Recommendation**: Use established TDDFT/excited-state codes with comprehensive documentation and active support
