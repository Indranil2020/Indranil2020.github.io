## Overview
PyTDDFT is a research/educational Python implementation of time-dependent density functional theory for learning and prototyping TDDFT methods. Developed by Fadjar Fathurrahman, PyTDDFT provides a transparent, readable implementation of TDDFT in Python, prioritizing code clarity and educational value over production performance. It serves as a platform for understanding TDDFT algorithms and experimenting with method development.
