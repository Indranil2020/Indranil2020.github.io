## Overview
DP-4 appears to be a variant or version designation related to DP-Code (Density Perturbation), likely referring to a specific implementation, version, or research tool within a particular group. Like DP-Code, it has no identifiable public presence as standalone software and is likely internal research terminology or a module designation rather than a distinct public software package.

**Status**: Research designation, not standalone public software

## Context

### Relation to DP-Code:
- Variant or version of DP approaches
- Research tool designation
- Internal to specific groups
- Not publicly distributed
- Specialized implementation

## Information Gap
- No public repository
- No documentation available
- Research group specific
- Not standalone software
- Internal designation

## Recommendation
For density perturbation and many-body calculations, use established codes:
- **Yambo**: GW/BSE with density response
- **BerkeleyGW**: Many-body perturbation theory
- **WEST**: Large-scale calculations
- **Quantum ESPRESSO**: DFPT and turbo modules

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: None accessible
**Secondary sources**: No verifiable information
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - No public information

**Verification status**: ⚠️ NOT STANDALONE SOFTWARE
- Status: **RESEARCH DESIGNATION** - Variant of DP-Code
- **Recommendation**: Use established production codes (Yambo, BerkeleyGW, WEST)
