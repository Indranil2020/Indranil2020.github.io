# NBSE (N-Body Schrödinger Equation / Bethe-Salpeter?)

## Official Resources
- Homepage: No public distinct repository found
- Documentation: Not available
- Source Repository: Not identified as standalone code
- License: Unknown

## Overview
NBSE has no identifiable public presence as a standalone code. The acronym could potentially refer to:
- N-Body Schrödinger Equation methods (general term)
- A specific BSE (Bethe-Salpeter Equation) solver (but no distinct code found)
- An internal research tool or module
- Part of another code's functionality

Without verifiable public sources, NBSE cannot be confirmed as a distinct software tool.

**Status**: Unverified, possibly method name or internal tool

## Possible Context

### BSE Solvers (if related):
Established codes with BSE capabilities:
- **Yambo**: Comprehensive BSE implementation
- **BerkeleyGW**: GW/BSE code
- **exciting**: All-electron BSE
- **Spex**: FLAPW-based BSE
- **molgw**: Molecular BSE

## Information Gap
- No public repository identified
- No official documentation found
- No active community
- Not referenced as standalone software
- Likely method abbreviation rather than software

## Recommendation
For Bethe-Salpeter Equation calculations, use established codes:
- **Yambo**: Production BSE for solids
- **BerkeleyGW**: Many-body BSE
- **exciting**: All-electron BSE
- **Spex**: FLAPW-based
- **molgw**: Molecular systems
- **WEST**: Large-scale

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: None accessible
**Secondary sources**: No verifiable information as distinct software
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - No distinct software identified

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Status: **NOT IDENTIFIED AS STANDALONE SOFTWARE**
- Possibly method abbreviation or internal module
- **Recommendation**: Use established BSE codes (Yambo, BerkeleyGW, exciting, Spex, molgw) for production calculations
