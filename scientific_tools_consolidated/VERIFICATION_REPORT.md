## Quality Assurance Process

### Verification Steps

1. **Initial Research**
   - Identified well-known, established codes
   - Cross-referenced against scientific publications
   - Consulted community forums and documentation

2. **URL Testing**
   - Accessed official websites directly
   - Verified GitHub repositories
   - Confirmed active development
   - Checked documentation availability

3. **Validation Criteria**
   - ✓ Working website or repository
   - ✓ Recent commits/updates
   - ✓ Active maintainers
   - ✓ Clear licensing
   - ✓ Citation information

4. **Exclusion Policy**
   - ❌ Any 404 errors
   - ❌ Abandoned projects (no updates in 5+ years, unless groundbreaking)
   - ❌ Broken GitHub repositories
   - ❌ Inaccessible websites
   - ❌ URLs created from speculation
