## Overview
**Status**: UNCERTAIN / EMERGING - "NCD" usually refers to "Novel Crystal Design" or similar niche tools. A likely candidate is "NCD-MFT" (Novel Crystal Design - Mean Field Theory), a tool for crystal structure prediction or analysis, but it lacks widespread documentation. Another possibility is "Non-Collinear Design". Without more specific context, this is a niche tool.

**Scientific domain**: Crystal structure prediction (presumed)  
**Target user community**: Specialized researchers

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Resources: Minimal
- Recommendation: Use **USPEX**, **CALYPSO**, or **AIRSS** for crystal structure prediction.
