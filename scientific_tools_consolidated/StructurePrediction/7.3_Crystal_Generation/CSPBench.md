# CSPBench

## Overview
CSPBench is a benchmark suite for evaluating crystal structure prediction algorithms. It provides standardized datasets, metrics, and evaluation protocols for comparing CSP methods.

## Theoretical Basis
- Benchmark dataset curation
- Performance metrics (match rate, RMSD, Chamfer distance)
- Standardized evaluation
- Algorithm comparison
- Reproducible benchmarking

## Key Capabilities
- 180 benchmark crystal structures
- Multiple evaluation metrics
- Standardized protocols
- Algorithm comparison framework
- Open-source codebase

**Sources**: arXiv:2407.00733

## Key Strengths
