## Overview
FLAME (Framework for Large-scale Agent-based Molecular Evolution) or similar acronyms exist. However, in the context of structure prediction, this entry might refer to a specific research code for optimization or learning. *Verification needed*: Is this "FLAME" related to structure prediction specifically? A more likely candidate for structure prediction might be *FLAME* as a module in a larger suite or a specific ML tool. 

*Correction*: FLAME is often associated with agent-based modeling. For materials structure prediction, there is a tool called **FLAME** (Framework for Learning and Materials Evolution) or similar? 

Actually, **FLAME** often refers to **Fireball-based Learning and Materials Exploration** or similar in specific contexts, but it's not a standard major code like USPEX. 

**Scientific domain**: Machine learning, materials design (Tentative)

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- *To be verified*

**Sources**: Pending

## Note
Due to name ambiguity, this tool requires specific verification of its domain.

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: Search ambiguous.

**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Recommendation: Clarify specific tool or use established alternatives.
