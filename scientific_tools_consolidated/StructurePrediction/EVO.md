## Overview
**Status**: UNCERTAIN - "EVO" is a generic name often used for "Evolutionary" algorithms. There are several codes with similar names (e.g., *Evo-lib*, *Evo* in USPEX, etc.). Without a specific link or context (e.g., "EVO crystal prediction"), it is difficult to identify a unique standalone software package named simply "EVO" that is widely distributed.

**Scientific domain**: Structure prediction (likely)  
**Target user community**: Unknown

## Note
If EVO refers to a specific research code, please provide the full name or citation. It might refer to:
- An internal module of another code
- A specific algorithm implementation (e.g., "Evolutionary Algorithm")
- A less common or legacy tool

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: None found

**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Resources: Unknown
- Recommendation: Use established tools like USPEX, XtalOpt, or CALYPSO for evolutionary structure prediction.
