## Overview
PyXtal-ML refers to the machine learning capabilities integrated within or associated with the PyXtal library. PyXtal generates structures with symmetry, and ML components (like descriptors or interfaces to ML potentials) allow for screening or guiding the structure generation process.

**Scientific domain**: Structure generation, machine learning  
**Target user community**: Materials scientists using ML for structure search

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- Generation of structures for ML training sets
- Symmetry-aware descriptors
- Integration with ML potentials for pre-screening
