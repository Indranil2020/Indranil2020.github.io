## Overview
**Status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN / GENERIC

"EVO" appears to be a generic abbreviation for **Evolutionary Algorithm** rather than a specific, standalone software package for crystal structure prediction. While many codes (USPEX, XtalOpt, MAISE, ASE-GA) use "Evo" or "Evolutionary" methods, no distinct tool named simply "EVO" has been verified as a standard community tool in this domain.

It is possible this refers to:
- **EvoLib**: A library for evolutionary computation (bioinformatics).
- **EVO (Bio)**: Protein structure prediction tools (e.g., Evoformer).
- An internal script or module not publicly distributed.

## Recommendation
For evolutionary structure prediction, use established and verified tools:
- **USPEX**
- **XtalOpt**
- **ASE-GA**
- **MAISE**

## Verification & Sources
- **Confidence**: ❌ UNVERIFIED
- **Action**: Flagged for potential removal or clarification.
