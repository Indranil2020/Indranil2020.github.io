## Overview
**Status**: UNCERTAIN - "Berry-Phase" is a physical concept (method), not a single specific software package name. Most major DFT codes (VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, ABINIT) have built-in Berry phase implementations (modern theory of polarization). Several post-processing tools (BerryPI, Wannier90, Z2Pack) also calculate it.

**Scientific domain**: Electric polarization, topological phases  
**Target user community**: Solid-state physicists

## Note
This entry likely refers to the method itself or a generic reference to Berry phase calculators.
