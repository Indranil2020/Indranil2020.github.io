## Overview
**Status**: UNCERTAIN - "Chern-Number" appears to be a generic name or a placeholder for a script/method rather than a specific, widely-distributed software package with this exact name. Chern numbers are calculated by many tools (Wannier90, Z2Pack, PyProcar, WannierTools, Fukui's code), but a standalone code named simply "Chern-Number" is not a standard community tool.

**Scientific domain**: Topological invariants, Chern number calculation  
**Target user community**: Topological physics researchers

## Note
There is a code by T. Fukui (Hatsugai-Fukui method) often used for Chern numbers, sometimes referred to generically.
