# pyprocar

## 1. Description
**pyprocar** is a Python library for pre- and post-processing of electronic structure data from VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, Elk, and Abinit. It is particularly known for plotting band structures and projecting wavefunctions onto atoms and orbitals.

## 2. Capability Verification
- **Functionality**:
  - Band structure unfolding
  - Fermi surface plotting
  - Projected band structure analysis
  - Spin-texture plotting
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for multiple DFT codes (VASP, QE, etc.)
  - High-quality publication-ready plots
  - Command-line interface and Python API
