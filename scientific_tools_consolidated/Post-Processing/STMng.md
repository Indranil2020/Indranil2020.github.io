## Overview
**Confidence Level**: UNCERTAIN
**Status**: UNCERTAIN - "STMng" likely refers to a Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) simulation tool (perhaps "Next Generation"?). However, there is no prominent, widely-distributed software package with this exact name in the standard materials science community. It might be a specific research code from a single group or a typo for another tool (e.g., *bSKAN*, *Tersoff-Hamann* implementations).

**Scientific domain**: STM simulation, surface science  
**Target user community**: Surface physicists

## Theoretical Methods
[TO BE COMPLETED - Requires verification from official sources]

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- **Hypothetical**: Simulation of STM images from DFT data (Tersoff-Hamann approximation or Bardeen method).

**Sources**: Pending verification

## Inputs & Outputs
**Input formats**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Output data types**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

## Interfaces & Ecosystem
[TO BE COMPLETED - Requires verification]

## Limitations & Known Constraints
[TO BE COMPLETED - Requires official documentation review]

## Verification & Sources
**Primary sources**: [TO BE VERIFIED]

**Secondary sources**: [TO BE VERIFIED]

**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Resources: Unknown
- Recommendation: Use **VASP** (partial charge density), **Quantum ESPRESSO** (`pp.x`), **bSKAN**, or **Create-STM-Image** (from ASE/Pymatgen ecosystem) for STM simulations.
