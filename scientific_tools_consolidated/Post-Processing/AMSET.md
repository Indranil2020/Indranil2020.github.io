# AMSET

## 1. Description
**AMSET** (Ab initio Model for Scattering and Transport) is a code for calculating carrier transport properties (mobility, conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, etc.) from first-principles, taking into account various scattering mechanisms.

## 2. Capability Verification
- **Functionality**:
  - Calculation of carrier mobility and lifetime
  - Consideration of acoustic/optical phonon scattering, ionized impurity scattering, etc.
  - Solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)
- **Key Features**:
  - Interface with VASP (via vasprun.xml)
  - Highly efficient compared to full EPW calculations
  - Materials Project integration
