# Chinook (UNCERTAIN - Potential TB Tool)

## Official Resources
- Homepage: UNCERTAIN
- Documentation: Not clearly identified
- Source Repository: Unclear
- License: Unknown

## Overview
"Chinook" appears in the master list under tight-binding tools, but this name is ambiguous. "Chinook" is commonly known as a supercomputer name and may also refer to other scientific software. Without clear documentation or repository, the specific tight-binding code intended by this entry cannot be definitively verified.

**Scientific domain**: UNCERTAIN  
**Target user community**: UNCERTAIN

## Status
**Note**: Name ambiguity
- **Chinook supercomputer**: Well-known HPC system
- **Chinook (structure prediction)**: Different field
- **Chinook TB code**: If exists, source unclear

## Possible Interpretations
- Internal research code
- Group-specific tool
- Name confusion/typo
- Legacy code
- Supercomputer name misidentification

## Verification Attempts
- GitHub search: No clear TB tool match
- Literature search: No definitive TB code
- Common usage: Supercomputer name
- Community: Not identified as TB tool

## Recommendation
For tight-binding calculations, use established codes:
- **Wannier90**: From DFT
- **pythtb**: Python pedagogical
- **Kwant**: Transport
- **Pybinding**: Large-scale
- **TBmodels**: Symmetry-aware

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: UNCERTAIN - Name ambiguous

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (NAME AMBIGUITY)
- **Category**: UNKNOWN
- **Note**: "Chinook" listed in master list under tight-binding category but no clear tight-binding code identified. Name commonly refers to Chinook supercomputer (PNNL HPC system) or other unrelated software. May be:
  - Name confusion with supercomputer
  - Internal/unpublished research code
  - Group-specific tool
  - Misidentification
- **Recommendation**: Clarify which specific code intended, or use established TB tools for production work.
