# GreenCheetah

## Official Resources
- **Repository**: Not publicly available (previously listed as https://github.com/GreenCheetah/GreenCheetah)
- **License**: Unknown

## Overview
**GreenCheetah** appears to be a library or code for electronic structure and quantum transport calculations based on the **Green's function** method, specifically within the **KKR (Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker)** framework. Information about this code is scarce in public databases, suggesting it may be a private research code, an internal project, or a defunct repository.

**Scientific domain**: Quantum Transport, KKR, Green's Functions
**Target user community**: Specialist researchers (likely internal to a specific group)

## Theoretical Methods
- **KKR-GF**: Multiple scattering theory Green's function.
- **CPA**: Coherent Potential Approximation for disorder (implied by KKR context).

## Status & Verification
**Verification Status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED / MISSING
- **Note**: Extensive searches for "GreenCheetah code" or the specified GitHub repository yield no results. Use with caution or consider alternatives like **JuKKR** or **Munich SPR-KKR** for KKR-Green's function calculations.

## Comparison with Known Codes
- **vs. JuKKR**: JuKKR is a well-established, open-source KKR-GF code with active support.
- **vs. Kwant**: GreenCheetah (if KKR) would be all-electron/DFT-based, whereas Kwant is a tight-binding model solver.

## Recommendation
If looking for KKR-transport codes, refer to the **JuKKR** or **SPR-KKR** documentation.
