## Overview
N2P2 (Neural Network Potential Package) is a software package for training and using high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP) for atomistic simulations. Developed at the University of Vienna, it implements the Behler-Parrinello symmetry functions to describe atomic environments and train neural networks to reproduce first-principles potential energy surfaces.

**Scientific domain**: Machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, atomistic simulations  
**Target user community**: Materials scientists, computational physicists using ML potentials

## Theoretical Methods
- High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials (HDNNP)
- Behler-Parrinello symmetry functions (radial and angular)
- Neural network training (backpropagation, Kalman filter, etc.)
- Atomic energy decomposition
- Classical molecular dynamics with ML potentials

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- Training of neural network potentials from DFT data
- Prediction of energies and forces for large systems
- Interface with LAMMPS for MD simulations
- High efficiency compared to DFT
- Accuracy comparable to reference ab-initio method
- Parallel training and prediction (MPI/OpenMP)
- Support for multiple element types

**Sources**: N2P2 documentation, GitHub repository

## Inputs & Outputs
- **Input formats**: input.nn (parameters), scaling.data, weights files, input.data (training structures)
- **Output data types**: energy, forces, training metrics, prediction logs

## Interfaces & Ecosystem
- **LAMMPS**: Official interface for running MD with trained potentials
- **Python**: Tools for data preparation and analysis
- **VASP/QE**: Compatible via training data generation

## Workflow and Usage
1. Generate training data: Run DFT (VASP/QE) for diverse configurations
2. Prepare input: Convert DFT data to `input.data` format
3. Train: `nnp-train` to optimize weights
4. Validate: Check errors on test set
5. Production: Use `pair_style nnp` in LAMMPS with trained weights

## Performance Characteristics
- Orders of magnitude faster than DFT
- Slower than empirical potentials (EAM/LJ)
- Linear scaling with system size
- Parallelized for efficiency

## Application Areas
- Materials discovery
- Phase transitions
- Nanostructures and interfaces
- Catalysis (surface reactions)
- Water and aqueous systems

## Community and Support
- Open-source (GPL v3)
- GitHub repository
- Active development
- Growing user community
