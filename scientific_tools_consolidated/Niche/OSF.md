## Overview
The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free, open-source project management tool that supports researchers throughout their entire project lifecycle. It functions as a collaboration platform, allowing teams to manage files, data, code, and protocols in one centralized location. It integrates with many other services (GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, Dataverse) to act as a hub.

**Scientific domain**: Project management, open science, collaboration  
**Target user community**: Research teams, labs

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- **Project Management**: Hierarchical structure (Projects -> Components).
- **Add-ons**: Connects to GitHub, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, S3, Zotero, etc.
- **Registrations**: Freeze a project state (preregistration).
- **Preprints**: Host preprints (OSF Preprints).
- **Wiki**: Built-in documentation.

**Sources**: OSF website

## Inputs & Outputs
- **Input formats**: Files, Wikis, links
- **Output data types**: Project pages, DOIs (for registrations)

## Interfaces & Ecosystem
- **Integrations**: Connects disparate tools into a single workflow.
- **API**: Full read/write API.

## Workflow and Usage
1. Create OSF Project.
2. Add contributors.
3. Link GitHub repo (code) and Google Drive (data).
4. Write Wiki.
5. Make public when ready.
