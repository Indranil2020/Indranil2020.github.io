## Overview
**Status**: METHOD / CODE UNKNOWN - "Dual-fermions" is a theoretical *method* (Dual Fermion expansion) for going beyond DMFT to include non-local correlations. There are several research codes that implement this (e.g., within **ALPS**, **Triqs**, or standalone codes like **DF** from various groups), but there is no single dominant software package simply named "Dual-fermions".

**Scientific domain**: Many-body physics, DMFT extensions  
**Target user community**: Theoretical physicists

## Recommendation
Look for implementations of the Dual Fermion method in **Triqs** (`triqs_tpr`), **ALPS**, or specialized DMFT codes.

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (Refers to a method, not a specific tool)

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
