## Overview
**Status**: NICHE - Likely refers to a specific code for solving the Hubbard model using diagrammatic Monte Carlo or similar techniques in the Matsubara formalism. This appears to be a specialized research code rather than a general-purpose package.

**Scientific domain**: Many-body physics, Hubbard model  
**Target user community**: Theoretical physicists

## Capabilities (CRITICAL)
- **Model**: Hubbard model.
- **Method**: Likely Diagrammatic Monte Carlo or similar fermionic QMC.
- **Formalism**: Matsubara frequency domain.

## Verification & Sources
**Confidence**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN (Specific features require code inspection)

**Verification status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Resources: Minimal public documentation.
- Recommendation: Contact developers (Center for Quantum Materials Physics?) or check specific papers citing it.
