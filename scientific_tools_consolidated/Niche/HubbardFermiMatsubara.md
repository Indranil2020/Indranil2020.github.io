## Overview
**Status**: ⚠️ UNCERTAIN / RESEARCH CODE

"HubbardFermiMatsubara" appears to be a specific research code or script for solving the Hubbard model in the Matsubara formalism, likely using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) or similar techniques. It is not a widely distributed or documented software package. References to it are scarce and likely point to internal group codes (possibly related to the Haule Group or CQMP, but no public repository with this exact name is reliably accessible).

**Scientific domain**: Many-body physics, Hubbard model  
**Target user community**: Theoretical physicists (Internal research groups)

## Capabilities (Presumed)
- **Model**: Hubbard model.
- **Method**: Fermionic QMC or Diagrammatic expansion.
- **Formalism**: Matsubara frequency domain.

## Verification & Sources
